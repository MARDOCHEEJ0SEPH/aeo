**Why Transcripts Matter:**
AI can't watch videos, but it CAN read transcripts. Full transcripts make your video content searchable and citable.

### YouTube-Specific Checklist

- [ ] Question-format titles ("How Does X Work?")
- [ ] Year in title for freshness
- [ ] Detailed description (500+ words)
- [ ] Full transcript in description
- [ ] Chapter timestamps
- [ ] Links to written content
- [ ] Relevant hashtags (3-5 max)
- [ ] Custom thumbnail with text
- [ ] Cards to related videos
- [ ] End screen with resources

## LinkedIn AEO Strategy

### Article Format

**LinkedIn articles get indexed and cited - use them!**

## Blog/Website AEO Optimization

### Site Structure for AI Education

**Recommended Structure:**
```
Homepage
├── AI Fundamentals
│   ├── What is AI?
│   ├── AI vs ML vs DL
│   ├── How AI Works
│   └── AI Glossary
├── Learning Paths
│   ├── Beginner Roadmap
│   ├── Career Changer Guide
│   ├── Advanced Learning Path
│   └── Specialization Tracks
├── Tutorials
│   ├── ChatGPT Mastery
│   ├── Prompt Engineering
│   ├── Python for AI
│   └── Building AI Projects
└── Resources
    ├── Tools Comparison
    ├── Course Reviews
    ├── Best Practices
    └── FAQ
```

### Internal Linking Strategy

**Hub-and-Spoke Model:**

**Hub:** "Complete AI Learning Center"
**Spokes:** All specific topics

**Every spoke links to:**
- Hub page
- 2-3 related spokes
- Next logical learning step

**Example:**
"What is Machine Learning?" article links to:
← Back to AI Learning Center
→ Next: Types of Machine Learning
Related: Neural Networks Explained
Related: Machine Learning Career Guide

### Schema Implementation Priority

**Every Page:**
- Organization schema
- Breadcrumb schema

**Tutorial Pages:**
- HowTo schema
- VideoObject schema (if video embedded)

**Comparison Pages:**
- FAQPage schema

**Learning Path Pages:**
- Course schema

## Twitter/X Strategy
