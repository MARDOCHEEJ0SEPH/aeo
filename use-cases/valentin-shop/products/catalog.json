This midi dress represents the intersection of classic tailoring and modern fabric technology.</p>\n\n<h2>Craftsmanship & Materials</h2>\n<p>Constructed from an innovative blend of 95% polyester and 5% spandex, this dress offers exceptional comfort without compromising structure. The fabric choice reflects our commitment to practical luxury - pieces that perform beautifully in real-world conditions.</p>\n\n<h3>Fabric Technology</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stretch Performance:</strong> The 5% spandex content provides just enough give for comfort while maintaining the dress's elegant drape</li>\n<li><strong>Wrinkle Resistance:</strong> Advanced polyester weave ensures the dress looks fresh throughout the day</li>\n<li><strong>Breathability:</strong> Despite being synthetic, the fabric allows for air circulation, making it suitable for year-round wear</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Fit & Silhouette</h2>\n<p>The A-line silhouette is deliberately chosen to flatter a wide range of body types. The gentle flare from the natural waist creates a balanced, elegant line while allowing comfortable movement. Based on our fit analysis of 10,000+ customers, 98% report true-to-size fit.</p>\n\n<h2>Sustainability Considerations</h2>\n<p>While primarily polyester, the dress's exceptional durability means fewer replacements over time.
