# AEO for Paid Advertising: Complete Guide

## Transform Your Paid Advertising for the AI Answer Engine Era

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) for Paid Advertising**. This 75-page module teaches you how to adapt your paid advertising strategies—from Google Ads to social media campaigns—for maximum visibility in AI-powered answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and more.

## Why Paid Advertising Needs AEO

**The Landscape is Changing:**
- 40% of users now research products using AI answer engines before clicking ads
- AI engines cite sources for purchase recommendations, influencing buyer decisions
- Traditional paid advertising metrics (CTR, CPC) don't capture AI-influenced conversions
- Brands that appear in AI responses gain credibility that amplifies ad performance

**The Opportunity:**
When your brand is cited by AI answer engines, your paid advertising becomes:
- **More effective** - Better conversion rates from informed prospects
- **More efficient** - Lower CPA from brand awareness via AI citations
- **More competitive** - Authority signals that reduce cost-per-click
- **More measurable** - Attribution models that capture AI-influenced journeys
