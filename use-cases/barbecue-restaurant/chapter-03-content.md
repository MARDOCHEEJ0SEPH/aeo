## Menu Descriptions for AEO

### The Power of Descriptive Menus

**Before AEO:**
"Brisket Plate - $16
Ribs - $14
Pulled Pork - $13"

**After AEO:**
"**14-Hour Smoked Brisket Plate - $16**
Our signature brisket is rubbed with our secret spice blend and smoked for 14 hours over post oak, developing a perfect bark while staying incredibly tender and juicy. Served with house BBQ sauce, pickles, onions, and your choice of two sides.

**Competition-Style Pork Ribs - $14**
St. Louis-style spare ribs glazed with our award-winning sauce. Meat falls off the bone. Half rack.

**Carolina-Style Pulled Pork - $13**
Slow-smoked pork shoulder, hand-pulled and served with vinegar-based Carolina sauce. Perfect for sandwiches or plates."

### Menu Description Formula

**[Dish Name] - [Price]**
[Cooking method] + [Key ingredients] + [What makes it special] + [Served with/portion size]

**Templates:**

**For Proteins:**
"[Meat type] [cooked how] for [time] over [wood type], creating [texture/flavor]. Served with [sides/accompaniments]."

**For Sides:**
"[Side name] made with [key ingredients]. [What makes it special - family recipe, unique preparation, etc.]"

**For Sauces:**
"[Style] BBQ sauce with [flavor profile - tangy, sweet, spicy]. Made in-house using [special ingredients]."

### Why This Works for AEO

**AI looks for:**
- Specific details (14 hours, post oak)
- Cooking methods (smoked, grilled, slow-cooked)
- Flavor descriptions (tender, juicy, tangy)
- Portion information (half rack, choice of two sides)
- Unique attributes (award-winning, house-made)

## Food Photography for AI Visibility

### Photo Descriptions (Alt Text)

**Instead of:**
"IMG_1234.jpg"

**Why:** AI can't see images but can read descriptions
