## Review Management

### Generating Reviews

**Timing:**

**Message Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

I hope your [product name] arrived safely and you love it!

If you're happy with your purchase, I'd be so grateful if you could leave a review. Reviews help small shops like mine grow and help other shoppers find the perfect gifts.

[Link to leave review]

If there's ANY issue, please message me directly before leaving a review - I'll make it right!

Thank you for supporting handmade!
[Your name]
```

**Don't:**
- Offer incentives for reviews (against Etsy policy)
- Harass customers
- Ask more than once

### Responding to Reviews

**Positive Reviews:**
```
"Thank you so much, [Name]! I'm thrilled you love your [product]. Happy to create keepsakes for wonderful customers like you! 🎄"
```

**Keep it:**
- Brief (1-2 sentences)
- Grateful
- Personal
- Professional

**Negative Reviews:**
```
"I'm so sorry your experience wasn't perfect, [Name]. I'd love to make this right. Please message me directly so we can resolve this. Your satisfaction is my priority."
```

**Then:**
- Resolve privately
- Offer replacement/refund
- Ask if they'll update review (don't demand)

**Why Reviews Matter for AEO:**
- Quantity signals popularity
- Quality (star rating) signals trustworthiness
- Content (what people say) helps AI understand your products
- Response rate shows customer service

**Target:**
- 50+ reviews total
- 4.8+ star average
- 100% response rate

## Etsy Ads vs Organic Strategy

### When to Use Etsy Ads

**Use Ads When:**
- New shop (first 3 months)
- New listings (first 2 weeks)
- Peak season competition
- Slow organic traffic

**Budget:**
- Start: $5-10/day
- Test: $15-25/day
- Peak: $30-50/day (Nov-Dec)

**Strategy:**
Use ads to jumpstart visibility, then let organic (AEO-driven) traffic take over.

### Organic Growth Through AEO

**AEO Advantages:**
- No ongoing ad costs
- Higher quality traffic
- Better conversion rates
- Sustainable long-term

**Timeline:**
- Ads: Immediate but expensive
- AEO: 2-4 weeks to build but sustainable

**Best Approach:**
Ads (Oct-Nov) + AEO (ongoing) = Maximum results

## External Traffic Strategy

### Driving Non-Etsy Traffic

**Why:**
- Etsy rewards external traffic
- Diversifies customer sources
- Builds brand beyond platform
- AI often cites external content

**Methods:**

**Pinterest:**
- Create boards: "Christmas Gifts for Mom," etc.
- Pin each product 5+ times
- Use rich pins
- Schedule pins daily

**Instagram:**
- Product photos with links in bio
- Stories with swipe-ups (if available)
- Reels showing products
- Hashtags: #christmasgifts #etsychristmas #handmadechristmas

**TikTok:**
- Product showcases
- Making/process videos
- Gift idea series
- Link in bio to Etsy shop

**Facebook:**
- Share in relevant groups (check rules)
- Facebook Shop integration
- Product posts with Etsy links

**Blog/Website (Advanced):**
- Gift guides linking to Etsy
- Product stories
- Behind-the-scenes
- SEO-optimized content AI can cite

**Email Marketing:**
- Collect emails (offer discount)
- Weekly newsletters Oct-Dec
- Exclusive previews
- Abandoned cart follow-ups (via integrations)

## Customer Service Excellence

### Response Times

**Target:**
- 2 hours or less during business hours
- Within 24 hours always

**Why:**
- Etsy tracks this
- Affects "Star Seller" status
- Builds trust
- Prevents negative reviews

**Set Up:**
- Etsy app notifications
- Auto-reply for off hours
- FAQ page to reduce questions

### Common Questions & Template Answers

**Q: Can I customize this?**
A: "Yes! In 'Notes to Seller' at checkout, please provide [specific details needed]. I'll send a proof within 24 hours for approval."
