**Purpose:** Helps buyer visualize

**Photo 3: Close-Up Detail**
- Texture, engraving, quality
- Shows craftsmanship

**Alt Text:**
"Personalized wooden heart Christmas ornament with family names engraved, perfect gift for grandparents, handmade farmhouse holiday decoration"

**Why:** AI can't see images but reads file names and alt text
