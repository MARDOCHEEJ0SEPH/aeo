# Chapter 11: Medium Blog Posts for AEO
## Leverage Medium's Domain Authority for Answer Engine Rankings

Medium is uniquely powerful for AEO because it combines high domain authority (DA 95+) with built-in distribution systems that amplify your content beyond what's possible on a new blog.

2. **Built-in Discovery**: Medium's recommendation engine shows your content to interested readers algorithmically
3. **Google Indexing Speed**: Medium articles get indexed by Google within hours (sometimes minutes)
4. **AI Training Data**: Medium is part of datasets AI engines like ChatGPT and Perplexity were trained on
5. **Social Proof**: Claps, highlights, and comments signal quality to both readers and algorithms
6. **Cross-Platform Syndication**: Import tool allows canonical syndication from your blog
7. **Network Effect**: Publications with hundreds of thousands of followers distribute your work

## Medium SEO Tactics for AEO

### 1. Strategic Tagging (Use All 5 Tags)

Medium allows 5 tags per article. Use them strategically:

**Tag Strategy:**
- **Tag 1:** Broad, high-traffic tag (e.g., "Marketing")
- **Tag 2:** Medium-specificity tag (e.g., "Content Marketing")
- **Tag 3:** Niche tag related to your topic (e.g., "AEO")
- **Tag 4:** Related concept (e.g., "SEO")
- **Tag 5:** Emerging/trending tag (e.g., "AI")

**Research tags:**
- Type potential tag in Medium search
- See follower count (higher = more reach)
- Check recent article quality
- Balance competition vs. reach

### 2. Subtitle Optimization

The subtitle appears under your title in search results and previews.

**Bad subtitle:** "Here's what I learned"
**Good subtitle:** "A complete breakdown of strategies, tools, and tactics that helped me rank in ChatGPT and Perplexity within 30 days"

**Formula:** [Specific promise] + [Who it's for/what they'll get]

### 3. First Paragraph Matters

Medium's algorithm and Google both weigh opening heavily.

**Include in first 150 words:**
- Main keyword 2-3 times (naturally)
- Clear value proposition
- Hook to keep reading
- Credibility signal

### 4. Internal Linking Strategy

Link to 2-4 of your other Medium articles.

**Why:**
- Keeps readers in your ecosystem
- Builds topical authority
- Medium algorithm rewards this
- Increases total reading time

**How:**
- Add contextual links in body
- Add "More from me" section at end
- Link to related topics, not just latest posts

### 5. Image Optimization

**Hero image:**
- 1500px x 800px minimum
- High quality, relevant
- Can include text overlay
- Use Unsplash or create custom

**Body images:**
- Every 400-500 words
- Screenshots > stock photos
- Diagrams and charts for data
- Alt text not supported (but use captions)

### 6. Formatting for Scannability

**Use liberally:**
- H2 headers (##) for main sections
- Bold for key points
- Blockquotes for highlights
- Numbered/bulleted lists
- Code blocks for examples
- Horizontal rules (---) for sections

**Why:** Medium's algorithm tracks "read time" and completion rate. Good formatting increases both.

### 7. Publication Submission

**Top Medium Publications by Reach:**

| Publication | Followers | Focus | Acceptance Rate |
|-------------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **The Startup** | 800K+ | Entrepreneurship, tech | ~30% |
| **Better Marketing** | 300K+ | Marketing, growth | ~40% |
| **UX Collective** | 500K+ | Design, UX | ~25% |
| **Towards Data Science** | 600K+ | AI, data, ML | ~35% |
| **The Writing Cooperative** | 150K+ | Writing, creativity | ~50% |
| **Better Programming** | 200K+ | Software dev | ~40% |

**How to get accepted:**
1. Follow publication guidelines (each has submission page)
2. Read 3-5 recent articles (match style/quality)
3. Submit your best work first
4. Write specifically for their audience
5. Build relationship before pitching

## Canonical vs. Cross-Posting Strategy

### Option 1: Canonical Link (Recommended for SEO)

**Process:**
1. Publish article on YOUR blog first
2. Wait 7-14 days for Google to index
3. Import to Medium using "Import a story" feature
4. Medium automatically adds canonical tag to your original

**Pros:**
- SEO credit goes to your domain
- No duplicate content penalty
- Medium still distributes widely
- Builds YOUR site authority

**Cons:**
- Medium distribution may be slightly lower
- Two-step publishing process

**Best for:** Building your own brand/domain authority

### Option 2: Medium-First Publishing

**Process:**
1. Publish natively on Medium
2. Submit to relevant publications
3. After 14-30 days, republish to your blog
4. Add canonical tag on your blog pointing to Medium

**Pros:**
- Maximum Medium distribution
- Faster initial reach
- Publication acceptance easier
- Immediate comments/engagement

**Cons:**
- SEO credit goes to Medium
- Harder to build domain authority

**Best for:** New writers building audience, or maximizing reach over SEO

### Option 3: Unique Content Strategy

**Process:**
1. Write unique Medium-only articles
2. Write unique blog-only articles
3. No overlap, no canonical issues

**Pros:**
- No duplicate content concerns
- Optimize each for platform
- More total content produced

**Cons:**
- More time investment
- Doesn't leverage existing content

**Best for:** Prolific writers with time/budget
