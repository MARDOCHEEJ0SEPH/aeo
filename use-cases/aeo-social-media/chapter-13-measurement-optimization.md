Check if your content is cited in sources.

(Note: This won't work directly but check for content scrapers that reference AI responses)

## ROI Measurement

### Attribution Tracking

**UTM Parameters for All Links:**
```

### Funnel Tracking

```

Create your own scoring system:

```
Content Score =
  (Reach x 0.2) +
  (Engagement Rate x 30) +
  (Saves x 5) +

Adjust weights based on your goals.
