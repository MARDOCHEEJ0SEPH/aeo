## Prompt Engineering for Citations

### Understanding How Users Actually Query

**The key insight:**
Your content must match not just topics, but the specific ways users ask questions.

**Traditional keyword research:**
"CRM software" - 12,000 searches/month

**ChatGPT prompt research:**
- "I need a CRM for a 10-person sales team that integrates with Gmail and costs under $100/month. What should I use?"
- "We're migrating from Salesforce to something simpler. What CRM alternatives are there for small businesses?"
- "How do I choose between HubSpot and Pipedrive for a B2B SaaS company?"

**The difference:**
ChatGPT queries are 5-10x longer and include context, constraints, and specific situations.

### Reverse Engineering Citation-Winning Prompts

**Step 1: Test target queries**

Test variations of your target query:
- Short version: "best CRM for small business"
- Medium version: "what's the best CRM software for a small business with 10 employees?"
- Long version: "I run a 10-person consulting firm and need a CRM that integrates with Gmail and Google Calendar, costs under $100/month, and is easy to use without technical training. What should I consider?"

**Step 2: Document which version cites you**

**Results:**
- Short version: Competitor A cited
- Medium version: Competitor B cited
- Long version: YOUR SITE cited!

**Learning:**
Your content is optimized for detailed, context-rich queries. Double down on this.

**Step 3: Analyze the pattern**

What do citation-winning queries have in common?
- Specific constraints mentioned (budget, team size, integrations)
- Use cases described (consulting firm, specific workflow)
- Pain points expressed (current problem, frustration)
- Qualifiers included (easy to use, no technical training)

**Step 4: Optimize content for those patterns**

Update your content to explicitly address:
```markdown
## Best CRM for 10-20 Person Teams

### If You're Migrating from Spreadsheets

Many consulting firms outgrow spreadsheets around 10 employees.
Here's what to look for in your first CRM:

**Must-have features for former spreadsheet users:**
1. Simple interface (easy as Excel)
2. Gmail/Google Workspace integration
3. Minimal setup time (< 2 hours)
4. Affordable ($50-100/month for 10 users)
5. No technical training required

[Continue with specific recommendations...]

### If You're Migrating from Enterprise CRM (Salesforce, Dynamics)

If Salesforce felt like overkill, you need something with power
but better UX. Consider:

```

### Creating Cite-able Content Blocks

**The citation unit:**
ChatGPT tends to cite 2-4 sentence blocks that:
- Answer a specific question
- Provide concrete information
- Include relevant context
- Are self-contained

**Example of cite-able block:**

✅ **Highly cite-able:**
```
For a 10-person team, expect to pay $50-100/month for a business
CRM. Popular options include HubSpot Sales ($45/month for 2 users + $23/additional),
Pipedrive ($12.50/user/month = $125 total), and Copper ($25/user/month = $250 total).
Most offer 14-day free trials and month-to-month plans with no long-term contracts.
```

❌ **Poorly cite-able:**
```
Pricing varies widely. There are many options. Some are expensive,
others are affordable. It depends on your needs and budget.
Contact vendors for quotes.
```

**Why the first works:**
- Specific price points
- Multiple concrete examples
- Clear context (team size)
- Actionable information
- Complete thought

### Prompt Engineering Testing Framework

**Week 1: Baseline**
- Test 50 core queries
- Document current citation rate
- Note competitor citations

**Week 2: Variation testing**
- Test 10 variations of each core query
- Short/medium/long versions
- Different phrasings
- Various contexts

**Week 3: Pattern analysis**
- Which query styles cite you most?
- What language patterns work?
- What contexts trigger citations?
- Which competitor queries cite them instead?

**Week 4: Content optimization**
- Update content for winning patterns
- Add missing contexts
- Expand successful sections
- Remove underperforming content

**Week 5: Validation**
- Re-test all queries
- Measure improvement
- Document new citation rate
- Iterate

## Competitive Displacement Strategies

### Analyzing Competitor Citations

**Step 1: Identify who's beating you**

For your top 10 target queries, document:
- Which competitors are cited
- What position they hold (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- What specific content is cited
- Why ChatGPT chose them

**Competitive citation matrix:**

| Query | 1st Citation | 2nd Citation | 3rd Citation | Your Position |
|-------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Best CRM for small business | Competitor A (guide) | Competitor B (comparison) | YOUR SITE (review) | 3rd |
| CRM with Gmail integration | Competitor A (tutorial) | YOUR SITE (guide) | Competitor C (blog) | 2nd |

### Displacement Tactics

**Tactic 1: Comprehensive Superiority**

If competitor has 2,000-word article, create 5,000-word definitive guide.

**Their content:**
```
## Best CRM for Small Business

2. Pipedrive - Easy to use
3. Salesforce - Most features
4. Zoho - Good value
5. Copper - Google integration

**Tactic 2: Niche Authority**

Own subcategories competitors ignore.

**Competitor's broad content:**

**Your niche content:**

- "Best CRM for Nonprofits Under $50/Month" (specific budget + sector)
- "Best CRM with Native WhatsApp Integration" (specific feature)
- "Best CRM for Solo Consultants" (specific size)

**Result:**
You dominate specific long-tail queries competitors miss.

**Tactic 3: Freshness Advantage**

**Their content:**
"Best CRM 2024" (published Jan 2024, last updated Mar 2024)

**Your content:**

**Freshness signals:**
- Publish date in title
- "Last updated: [date]" at top
- "Updated weekly" badge
- Recent examples (2025 data)

       (citing others)

       we found an average ROI of 4.2:1, with top performers

## Advanced Schema Markup Strategies

### Nested Schema for Rich Context

**Basic schema:**
```json
{
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Best CRM for Small Business"
}
```

**Advanced nested schema:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Best CRM for Small Business (2025)",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "jobTitle": "CRM Consultant",

      "name": "HubSpot CRM",
      "offers": {
        "@type": "Offer",
        "price": "45",
        "priceCurrency": "USD"
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
      "name": "Pipedrive",
      "offers": {
        "@type": "Offer",
        "price": "12.50",
        "priceCurrency": "USD"
      }
    }
  ],
  "citation": [
    {
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "name": "CRM Market Research 2025",
      "author": "Gartner"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Dynamic Schema

**Update schema automatically:**
```javascript
// Update dateModified automatically
const schemaScript = document.querySelector('script[type="application/ld+json"]');
const schema = JSON.parse(schemaScript.textContent);
schema.dateModified = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
schemaScript.textContent = JSON.stringify(schema);
```

- Use case entities (sales tracking, customer service, etc.)
- Industry entities (real estate, consulting, etc.)
- Integration entities (Gmail, Slack, etc.)

**Entity linking:**
```markdown
## Best CRM for Small Business

When evaluating [[Customer Relationship Management]] systems,
consider these core capabilities:

1. [[Contact Management]]: Store and organize customer information
2. [[Sales Pipeline]]: Track deals from lead to close
3. [[Email Integration]]: Connect with [[Gmail]] or [[Outlook]]
4. [[Reporting]]: Generate [[sales reports]] and [[forecasts]]

For [[real estate agents]], [[real estate CRM]] features like
[[property listings]] and [[showing schedules]] are essential.

Popular options include [[HubSpot]], [[Pipedrive]], and [[Salesforce]].
Each has strengths for different [[use cases]].
```

**Benefits:**
- ChatGPT understands relationships between concepts
