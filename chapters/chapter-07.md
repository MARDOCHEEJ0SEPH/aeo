# Why 73% of B2B Leads Never Become Opportunities

## The B2B Lead Quality Crisis

Industry benchmark data shows:
- Average B2B website converts 2-3% of visitors
- Only 27% of leads ever become sales opportunities
- Sales teams spend 50% of time on unqualified leads

## Root Causes

**1. Lack of Lead Scoring**
Without behavioral and demographic scoring, all leads treated equally.

**2. Poor Lead-to-Sales Handoff**
Marketing and sales operate in silos.

**3. No Lead Nurturing**
Early-stage leads receive same treatment as late-stage buyers.

## Solution Framework

Marketing automation solves this through:
- Intelligent lead scoring (demographic + behavioral)
- Automated nurturing campaigns
- Marketing-sales alignment tools
- Multi-touch attribution
```

**Why This Works:**
- Addresses business problem first
- Provides data and frameworks
- Naturally transitions to solution
- AI can extract problem → solution connection

### Solution Awareness Stage

**Queries:**
- "Best [product category]"
- "[Product category] comparison"
- "Do we need [product category]?"
