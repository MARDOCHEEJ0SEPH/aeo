## Step 1: Audience Research

Before optimizing for answer engines, understand WHO is asking questions about your business.

### Customer Segmentation

**For each customer segment, identify:**

1. **Demographics**
   - Age range
   - Location
   - Income level
   - Education

2. **Psychographics**

## Step 2: Question Discovery

The heart of AEO is answering the right questions. Here's how to find them.

### Method 1: Direct Customer Conversations

**Ask your sales team:**
- "What are the top 10 questions prospects ask?"
- "What objections come up most often?"
- "What do customers want to know before buying?"

**Ask your customer support team:**
- "What do customers struggle to understand?"
- "What's in your FAQ/help documentation?"
- "What questions repeat constantly?"

**Ask your customers directly:**
- Survey recent customers
- Review sales call recordings
- Analyze support tickets

### Method 2: Search Data Analysis

**Tools to use:**
- Google Search Console: "Queries" report
- Google Autocomplete: Type your topic + question words
- "People Also Ask" boxes in Google results
- AnswerThePublic.com: Question visualization
- AlsoAsked.com: Related questions mapping

**Question words to explore:**
- What, Why, How, When, Where, Who
- Can, Should, Will, Does, Is, Are
- Best, Top, Recommended, Trusted
- Versus, Compared to, Alternative to

### Method 3: Competitor Analysis

**What to analyze:**
- Their FAQ pages
- Blog content (focus on titles with "How", "Why", "What")
- Customer reviews (what questions appear?)
- Their social media Q&A
- Comments on their content

### Method 4: AI Answer Engine Testing

**Try asking AI:**
```
"What questions do people ask about [your industry]?"
"What do small business owners want to know about [your service]?"
"Common concerns about [your product category]?"
```

AI will generate relevant questions based on its training data.

### Question Collection Spreadsheet

Create a spreadsheet with these columns:

| Question | Search Volume | Customer Segment | Intent | Priority | Current Coverage |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| "How much does social media marketing cost?" | High | Small Business | Commercial | High | None |
| "What is ROI in marketing?" | High | Startups | Informational | Medium | Partial |
| "Best marketing agency in Austin?" | Medium | All | Commercial | High | Good |

## Step 3: Competitive Analysis

Analyze which questions your competitors are already answering well.

### Competitor AEO Audit Process

**For each main competitor:**

1. **AI Citation Test**
   - Ask ChatGPT relevant industry questions
   - Note if competitor is mentioned
   - Analyze why they're cited

2. **Content Analysis**
   - Review their FAQ pages
   - Check blog content structure
   - Evaluate answer directness
   - Note their question coverage

3. **Structured Data Check**
   - Use schema markup validator
   - Check FAQ schema implementation
   - Review product/service schemas
   - Note their technical AEO

### Example: Marketing Agency Competitive Analysis

**Competitor A:**
- ✅ Comprehensive FAQ page
- ✅ Cited by ChatGPT for pricing questions
- ✅ Clear service descriptions
- ❌ No structured data markup
- ❌ Old content (2022)

**Competitor B:**
- ✅ Updated blog content

**Opportunity:**
Create structured, current content with schema markup to beat both.
