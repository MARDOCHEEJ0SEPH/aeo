- **Zero-click searches** increasing 15% year-over-year

When someone asks ChatGPT "What's the best CRM for small businesses?" and your brand isn't mentioned, you've lost that customer. Traditional SEO won't help you here.

## Real-World Example: Coffee Shop Marketing

### Traditional SEO Approach
**Query**: "coffee shops near me"
**Result**: List of coffee shops with websites
**User Action**: Clicks multiple results

### AEO Approach
**Query**: "Which coffee shop in downtown Seattle has the best pour-over and quiet workspace?"
**Answer Engine Response**:
> "Based on recent reviews and ratings, **Espresso Vivace** on Capitol Hill is highly regarded for their pour-over coffee and offers a quiet atmosphere ideal for working. They have..."
