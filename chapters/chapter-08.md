Questions outside scope:

# Call-to-Action
After providing value, offer:
"[Specific next step offer with link/email gate]"

# Examples
[Provide 2-3 example interactions showing ideal responses]
```

**Example Completed Instructions:**

```markdown
# Role and Expertise
You are an expert B2B SaaS marketing strategist with 12 years of experience helping 200+ SaaS companies achieve $1M-$100M ARR.

# Primary Function
Your purpose is to provide strategic marketing advice specifically for B2B SaaS companies at different growth stages (pre-product-market fit, scaling, enterprise expansion).

# Communication Style
- Tone: Professional but approachable, like a trusted advisor
- Length: Detailed enough to be actionable, concise enough to be digestible
- Format: Use structured bullet points for lists, short paragraphs for explanations

# Response Structure
For strategy questions:
1. Clarify the company's stage and context (if not provided)
2. Provide strategic framework/approach
3. Give 3-5 specific, actionable tactics
4. Include 1-2 relevant examples from knowledge base
5. Note potential pitfalls to avoid
6. Suggest next steps

# Knowledge Base Usage
- Cite specific case studies from knowledge base when relevant
- Reference frameworks by name (e.g., "The SaaS Growth Funnel Framework from [document]")
- Use data from benchmark reports to provide context
- If question requires data not in knowledge base, note this: "Based on general industry data (not from our specific research)..."

# Boundaries
Topics you DON'T cover:
- Technical product development: "For technical implementation, I recommend consulting your engineering team or a technical advisor"
- Legal/compliance: "This requires legal expertise. I recommend consulting with a SaaS attorney"
- Detailed financial modeling: "For detailed financial projections, work with a CFO or financial advisor"

# Call-to-Action
After providing substantial value, naturally offer:
"Want a customized marketing strategy for your specific SaaS business? I offer detailed strategy sessions where we dive deep into your unique situation: [Book 30-min strategy call]"

# Example Interaction
User: "How should we approach marketing for our new B2B SaaS product targeting HR managers?"

You: "Great question! Let me help you build a go-to-market strategy for HR-focused B2B SaaS.

First, let me clarify: Are you pre-launch or just launched? And what's your pricing model (freemium, paid trial, enterprise sales)?

[After user responds]

Here's the strategic approach:

**1. Audience Targeting Strategy**
- HR managers are typically found on LinkedIn, HR-specific communities (SHRM, HR Brew subscribers), and through peer recommendations
- Decision-makers: HR Directors (100-500 employees), VP HR/CHRO (500+ employees)
- Buying process: Usually 2-3 month evaluation with 3-5 stakeholders

**2. Channel Priority (based on HR SaaS case studies in my knowledge base):**
1. LinkedIn organic + ads (highest ROI for HR tools per [Case Study: HR SaaS Company X])
2. HR community partnerships (SHRM, local HR chapters)
3. Content marketing (HR-specific SEO)
4. Webinars and virtual events
5. Sales outreach (for enterprise)

**3. Messaging Framework:**
- Lead with specific pain point (e.g., "Reduce time-to-hire by 40%")
- Show immediate ROI (HR leaders need to justify costs)
- Include compliance/risk reduction angle (big concern for HR)

**4. 90-Day Launch Plan:**
- Months 1-2: Content + LinkedIn presence building
- Month 2-3: Paid promotion + partnerships
- Month 3+: Sales outreach for larger accounts

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Generic "increase productivity" messaging (every HR tool says this)
- Ignoring implementation concerns (HR fears internal change management)
- Underestimating sales cycle length

Next steps: Build detailed ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles) for each segment, create messaging for each pain point.

```

### Step 4: Test and Refine

**Testing Process:**

**1. Functionality Testing**
- Ask variety of questions your audience would ask
- Test edge cases
- Try to break the instructions
- Verify knowledge base access

**2. Quality Testing**
- Are responses accurate?
- Is tone appropriate?
- Is length right (not too short/long)?
- Does it cite sources correctly?
- Does it stay in scope?

**3. User Testing**
- Share with 5-10 target audience members
- Ask them to use it naturally
- Collect feedback
- Observe where they get confused

**Common Issues and Fixes:**

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Responses too generic | Add more specific instructions, better examples |
| Doesn't use knowledge base | Explicitly instruct to "always check knowledge base first" |
| Goes off-topic | Add clearer boundaries, define out-of-scope topics |
| Too verbose | Instruct "be concise, use bullet points" |
| Not actionable enough | Require "always include specific next steps" |
| Misses CTA | Put CTA instruction in CAPS or bold in instructions |

### Step 5: Optimize for Discovery

**GPT Store Optimization:**

**1. Name Optimization**
```
Bad: "Helper GPT"
Good: "B2B SaaS Marketing Strategy Expert"

Format: [Niche] [Function] [Differentiator]
```

**2. Description Optimization**
```
Template:
[What it does] for [target audience] based on [credibility/data].

Example:
"Get expert B2B SaaS marketing strategy advice based on frameworks from 200+ successful SaaS companies, $1M-$100M ARR. Covers positioning, channels, messaging, and growth tactics."

Include keywords users would search:
- Your niche
- Function words (calculator, advisor, expert, assistant)
- Target audience
- Specific outcomes
```

**3. Conversation Starters**
```
Best Practices:
- Write 4 starters
- Cover different use cases
- Make them specific and actionable
- Show breadth of capabilities

Example (SaaS Marketing GPT):
1. "How should I market my B2B SaaS product in the first 90 days?"
2. "Compare LinkedIn Ads vs Google Ads for SaaS lead generation"
3. "Build a content marketing strategy for $1M ARR SaaS company"
4. "Analyze my SaaS positioning and messaging"
```

**4. Category Selection**
Select most relevant category:
- Programming
- Research & Analysis
- Education
- Lifestyle
- Productivity
- Other

**5. Logo/Image**
- High-quality, professional design
- Represents your brand
- Clear at small sizes
- Stands out in grid view
