## How AI Engines Handle Local Queries

### The Local Query Processing Flow

**User Query:** "Best coffee shop near me"

**AI Processing Steps:**

**Step 1: Location Detection**
- Device GPS data
- IP address geolocation
- User-specified location in chat
- Previous conversation context

**Step 2: Intent Analysis**
- "Best" = recommendation request
- "Coffee shop" = business category
- "Near me" = proximity requirement
- Current time consideration (is it open now?)

**Step 3: Data Source Consultation**
- Web crawl data (business websites)
- Structured data (LocalBusiness schema)
- Google Business Profile information
- Review aggregation sites
- Local directories
- Social media mentions

**Step 4: Ranking and Recommendation**
Factors considered:
- Proximity to user
- Business rating/reviews
- Operating hours (open now?)
- Category relevance
- Content quality/completeness
- Authority signals

**Step 5: Response Generation**
"Based on your location, here are the top coffee shops near you:

1. **Brew Haven** (0.3 miles) - 4.8★ (342 reviews)

### Local Query Types

**AI Behavior:** Uses device location, prioritizes proximity + rating

**Type 2: Specific Location Queries**

- "Hair salon in Brooklyn"

**AI Behavior:** Uses specified location, broader radius acceptable

**Type 3: Service + Location Queries**

- "24-hour pharmacy Chicago"
- "Weekend auto repair Austin"

**AI Behavior:** Time-sensitive, prioritizes availability

**Type 4: Comparative Local Queries**
- "Best coffee shop vs Starbucks in Portland"
- "Local gym vs Planet Fitness"

**AI Behavior:** Compares local independent to chains

**Type 5: Problem-Solution Local Queries**
- "Flat tire, need help in Austin"
- "Lost phone, where to get replacement today"
- "Urgent dental pain, open Saturday"

**AI Behavior:** Urgency-focused, immediate availability critical

## Google Business Profile Optimization for AEO

### Why GBP is Critical for Local AEO

**Google Business Profile Data Powers AI:**
- Business name, address, phone
- Categories and attributes
- Operating hours
- Reviews and ratings
- Photos and videos
- Q&A section
- Posts and updates

**AI engines pull GBP data directly or indirectly through:**
- Google's Knowledge Graph
- Local search results scraping
- Structured data correlation

### Complete GBP Optimization Framework

**1. Business Information Accuracy**

**NAP Consistency (Name, Address, Phone):**
```
❌ Inconsistent:
Website: "Joe's Plumbing Services LLC"
GBP: "Joe's Plumbing"
Citations: "Joe Plumbing Services"

✅ Consistent Everywhere:
"Joe's Plumbing Services"
123 Main St, Suite 100
Austin, TX 78701
(512) 555-0123
```

**Business Name Optimization:**
```
❌ Keyword-stuffed:
"Joe's Plumbing | Best Plumber Austin | Emergency Plumbing 24/7"

✅ Clean + Descriptive:
"Joe's Plumbing Services"

(Use business category and attributes fields for keywords)
```

**2. Category Selection**

**Primary Category:** Most specific, accurate category
```
Example - Coffee Shop:
Primary: "Coffee shop"

Not: "Cafe" (less specific)
Not: "Restaurant" (too broad)
Not: "Coffee roastery" (unless you actually roast)
```

**Additional Categories:** Relevant secondary services
```
Coffee Shop Additional Categories:
- "Breakfast restaurant"
- "Wi-Fi spot"
- "Dessert shop" (if applicable)

Maximum: Choose all relevant (up to 10)
```

**3. Attributes Selection**

Enable ALL accurate attributes:
```
Service Options:
✓ Dine-in
✓ Takeout
✓ Delivery
✓ Curbside pickup

Amenities:
✓ Free Wi-Fi
✓ Outdoor seating
✓ Wheelchair accessible
✓ Good for working
✓ Dogs allowed

Planning:
✓ Reservations accepted
✓ Walk-ins welcome

Payments:
✓ Credit cards accepted
✓ Cash only (if true)
```

**Why This Matters:**
AI answers specific queries: "Coffee shops with WiFi near me" or "Dog-friendly cafe"

**4. Operating Hours Optimization**

**Standard Hours - Be Detailed:**
```
Monday: 7:00 AM - 8:00 PM
Tuesday: 7:00 AM - 8:00 PM
Wednesday: 7:00 AM - 8:00 PM
Thursday: 7:00 AM - 8:00 PM
Friday: 7:00 AM - 9:00 PM
Saturday: 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
Sunday: 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM
```

**Special Hours:**
- Holiday hours (mark specific dates)
- Temporary changes
- Seasonal hours

**Why Accuracy Matters:**
"Open now" is a critical filter. Incorrect hours = lost customers.

**5. Business Description Optimization**

**GBP Description (750 character limit):**
```
❌ Generic:
"We're a great coffee shop serving quality coffee in a friendly atmosphere. Come visit us for the best coffee experience!"

✅ AEO-Optimized:

## Chapter Summary

- Local AEO requires location-specific optimization beyond general business strategies
- Google Business Profile is critical - complete every section thoroughly
- LocalBusiness schema must include geo-coordinates, hours, and all relevant details
- Create unique content for each service area and major neighborhood
- Reviews are social proof AI engines heavily weight for local recommendations
- Multi-location businesses need individual pages with unique content per location
- Emergency and time-sensitive queries require specialized optimization
- "Open now" and availability must be prominently displayed and marked up

## Key Takeaways

1. **NAP consistency is non-negotiable** - Same everywhere or AI gets confused
2. **Complete GBP fully** - Every field matters for local AI visibility
3. **Geo-coordinates are critical** - Required for proximity-based recommendations
4. **Reviews drive local rankings** - Quality and quantity both matter
5. **Unique local content wins** - Don't duplicate templates across locations
6. **Neighborhood names matter** - Use hyperlocal terminology residents recognize
7. **Availability prominence critical** - "Open now" must be obvious and accurate
8. **Emergency optimization differs** - 24/7 availability needs special treatment
